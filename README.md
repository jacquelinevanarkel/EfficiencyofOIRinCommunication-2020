# OIRinRSA-2020
**Research Project at the Radboud University**

This repository will be mainly used to track and share my progress in implementing the RSA model with Other-Initiated Repair (OIR). Furthermore, I will also keep the to-do list up-to-date, in which can be seen what I'm currently working on, what I've finished and what I'm still planning to start working on in that week/coming few weeks. I'll archive the finished to-do's ('issues' in Github) after I'm done with a working part (WP: see research proposal), in Github defined as a milestone. This overview can be found under 'Projects' --> 'OIRinRSA'.
